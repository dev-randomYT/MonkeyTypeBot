# **Monkey Type Bot**

## _A Bot For Monkey Type that currently can reach around 1500 WPM on a 100 word sprint._  
By dev_randomYT


### _There are two different types of bot here._  
***
### Manual
You have to manually type in the words which takes a long time,  
Average of 10000 WPM,   
Uses keyboard to type at an uncontrollabe speed.  
Impractical though works on all typing websites.  
Speed makes it suspicious

***
### Automatic
Opens Monkey Type and allows 7 seconds to choose mode.  
Average of 1500 WPM,  
Uses Keyboard though is limited as program will bug if not,  
Practical though still contains minor bugs that only allow support for custom or set word runs,  
Speed is lesser suspicios though may raise anticheat flags,
